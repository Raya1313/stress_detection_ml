# Stress Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project explores the use of **machine learning** to detect stress levels from data.  
The goal is to preprocess the dataset, build predictive models, and evaluate their ability to classify stress in individuals.

The repository includes datasets, source code for preprocessing and modeling, and output results generated during experimentation.

---

## Repository Structure
- data/ → contains the dataset(s) used for training and evaluation.  
- src/ → source code and Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- stress level output/ → model predictions, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.  

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Recommended libraries:
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - scikit-learn  
  - seaborn  
  - jupyter  

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raya1313/stress_detection_ml.git
   cd stress_detection_ml
   ```

2. Place the dataset into the `data/` folder (if not already included).

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in `src/` to:
   - Preprocess the dataset  
   - Train machine learning models  
   - Evaluate performance  

4. Generated results and plots will be stored in `stress level output/`.

---

## Results
The output includes:
- Stress level predictions (classified categories or scores).  
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).  
- Visualizations of feature importance and model evaluation.  

(Add screenshots or sample tables here if available.)

## Future Work
- Experiment with deep learning approaches.  
- Improve data preprocessing for imbalanced datasets.  
- Deploy the model as a web or mobile application.
